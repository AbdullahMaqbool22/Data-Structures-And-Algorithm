## Introduction

This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of common data structures and algorithms using C++. Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for any programmer looking to solve complex problems efficiently.

## Data Structures

### 1. Array

An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. It is one of the simplest and most widely used data structures.

### 2. Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node points to the next node in the sequence.

### 3. Stack

A stack is a data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the top.

### 4. Queue

A queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added to the rear and removed from the front.

### 5. Tree

A tree is a hierarchical data structure with a root element and subtrees of children. Each child itself is a tree.

### 6. Graph

A graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges. It can be either directed or undirected.

### 7. Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array.

### 8. Heap

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.

### 9. Trie

A trie is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings.

### 10. Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

A disjoint-set data structure is a collection of non-overlapping sets. It is useful for solving problems related to connectivity.

### 11. Bloom Filter

A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.

## Algorithms

### 1. Sorting

Sorting algorithms arrange data in a particular order. Common sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

### 2. Searching

Searching algorithms are designed to find specific items within a data structure. Common searching algorithms include Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.

### 3. Recursion

Recursion involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems.

### 4. Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming involves solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems.

### 5. Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each stage to achieve a globally optimal solution.

### 6. Divide and Conquer

Divide and Conquer is a problem-solving paradigm that involves breaking a problem into subproblems, solving them, and combining their solutions.

### 7. Backtracking

Backtracking is a technique for solving problems recursively by trying out different possibilities and undoing choices when they lead to a dead end.

### 8. Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms operate on graphs to solve various problems, such as finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.

### 9. String Algorithms

String algorithms involve operations on strings, such as pattern matching, substring search, etc.

### 10. Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation involves operations at the bit-level, which can be used for tasks like bitwise operations and bitmasking.
